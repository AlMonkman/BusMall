This was a fun project. Figuring out how to use the dom to display the objects and then also removing them. I also really enjoyed the CSS aspect of this. Flex and grid display are amazing.

Busmall

Create a survey in which people select the images of products they are most likely to purchase, with no duplicates shown. Then display the results back to them. Save the data to local storage so that revisiting users will have all that data to refer to.

I really enjoyed this project. It takes just about everything we have learned at code fellows, and combines them all in one lab. The local storage seems simple but was tricky to get working. Also preventing duplicates took a lot of brain power to figure out.
